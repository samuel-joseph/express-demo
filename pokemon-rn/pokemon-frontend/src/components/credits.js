        This game is called Pokemon Joetoh League it is purely inspired by
        Pokemon Red which is one of my favoirte game. The desgin and styling
        also came from my very first gameboy console which is the gameboy color
        so I really tried my best to replicate it and bring an OG and nostalgic
        feeling for the user. This is my final project coming from the coding
        bootcamp, I worked very hard for this project and I really hope that
        you'll enjoy this game!
